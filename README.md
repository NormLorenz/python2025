# Python2025 Project Summary

## Overview

This project demonstrates basic Python scripting and data manipulation using pandas. It includes:

- Simple variable usage and print statements.
- Creating and exporting tabular data to a CSV file.

## File Structure

- **[main.py](main.py)**: Contains basic Python code with variable assignments and print statements.
- **[spreadsheet.py](spreadsheet.py)**: Uses pandas to create a DataFrame from sample data and exports it to a CSV file.
- **[example.csv](example.csv)**: The CSV file generated by `spreadsheet.py`, containing sample data about people.

## Details

### [spreadsheet.py](spreadsheet.py)

- Defines sample data for names, ages, and cities.
- Creates a pandas DataFrame from the data.
- Writes the DataFrame to `example.csv` with headers and without row indices.
- Notifies the user when the CSV file is saved.

### [main.py](main.py)

- Demonstrates variable assignment and basic arithmetic.
- Prints a greeting and the result of a modulus operation.

### [example.csv](example.csv)

- Contains the following columns: Name, Age, City.
- Example rows:
  - John, 28, San Francisco
  - Anna, 35, Paris
  - Peter, 42, London
  - Linda, 29, Post Falls

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library

## Usage

1. Run `spreadsheet.py` to generate `example.csv`:
   ```sh
   python spreadsheet.py
   ```
2. Run `main.py` to see basic Python output:
   ```sh
   python
